GQCNN
==========

Currently only the parallel Jaw Gripper is supported in the GQCNN solution.
This can be extended to Suction gripper. As a result for the GQCNN solution
the following pre-trained GQCNN models are available:

    - *GQCNN-4.0-PJ*: For `Dex-Net 4.0 <https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/#dexnet_4>`_, trained on images of objects in clutter with parameters for a PhotoNeo PhoXi S.
    - *FC-GQCNN-4.0-PJ*: For `FC-GQ-CNN <https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/fcgqcnn>`_, trained on images of objects in clutter with parameters for a PhotoNeo PhoXi S.
